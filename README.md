# My Big Bang Theory Trivia Game
### Overview

I've chosen my favorite sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, for my trivia game. Most of the questions are from my own memory of the show over the nine seasons it's been on the air.

The game is built with Bootstrap and JQuery and uses a single page, showing and hiding elements as needed. I use a countdown timer to limit the amount of time a player has for completing the questions.
